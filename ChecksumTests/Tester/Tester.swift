/**
 * Tester - represents a process for testing two folders for duplicates
 *
 * - Find all the media files (photo, audio, video) in a source folder and create a collection of file objects;
 * - Group the file objects into years to allow for sharding of the larger set of files in the target folder;
 * - Initial use of this will be to determine the fastest way of finding unique files by comparing times for
 * testing using various sizes of checksums and measuring the rate of distinction.
